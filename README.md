# Predictive Uncertainty with Deep Learning and Count Data

## Setup

### Install Project Dependencies

```bash
conda create --name deep-uncertainty python=3.10
conda activate deep-uncertainty
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install Pre-Commit Hook

To install this repo's pre-commit hook with automatic linting and code quality checks, simply execute the following command:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

When you commit new code, the pre-commit hook will run a series of scripts to standardize formatting. There will also be a flake8 check that provides warnings about various Python styling violations. These must be resolved for the commit to go through. If you need to bypass the linters for a specific commit, add the `--no-verify` flag to your git commit command.
