# Predictive Uncertainty with Deep Learning and Count Data

## Structure

This repo conatins two baselines: 
1. heteroscedastic-nn
2. faithful-heteroscedasticity

The two baselines will need to configurate with different requirement, please create two seperate environments and activate repsectively when conducting one of the baseline methods for comparison.

The `heteroscedastic-nn` has integrated the tabular data and can be ran by executing corresponding `py` files.

The `faithful-heteroscedasticity` has been tunned successfully and can replicate the original paper's training process, pending realizing the customized dataset.
